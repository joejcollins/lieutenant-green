You'll need a MongoDB account to spin up a free cluster.
There's no need to provide any payment details,
and the free cluster you'll spin up is _free forever_!
It's relatively restricted,
but easily good enough for a small app,
or for learning all of MongoDB's features.

[Sign up for a MongoDB account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register).
It'll only take a moment,
and then you can log in and spin up a database cluster.
