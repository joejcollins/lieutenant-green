There's a small FARM stack project already set up for you.
It's a To-Do app, for tracking your to-do list in MongoDB.

You can have a look at it in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/judy2k/farm-stack-workshop),
but you'll need to download it onto your computer to modify it.

If you're familiar with git, you can run `git clone git@github.com:judy2k/farm-stack-workshop.git -b starting-point`.

Otherwise, you can [download a ZIP](https://github.com/judy2k/farm-stack-workshop/archive/refs/heads/starting-point.zip) of the source code.

Whichever way you get the code, make sure you obtain the "starting-point" branch, _not_ "main"!
The "main" branch contains _spoilers_.
